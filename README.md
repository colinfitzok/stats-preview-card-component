### What I learned

I went into this project thinking that I had gotten a stronger grasp on some responsiveness concepts than I had during my previous two projects, so my goal was to just get some more real practice. 

Most of the things I learned for the first time on this project deal with the image element: using mix-blend-modes and opacity in conjunction to add a tint to a grayscale photo, making an image responsive at different sizes, using object-fit to get the image to crop in at narrower desktop screen sizes rather than stretch or overflow (which may be a less-than-ideal solution but was still interesting to do). Everything else was just solid practice.

### Continued development

While I got through my mobile design confident and proud of the clarity of the code and cleanness of the end result, I feel like it was a struggle to get it to work at the desktop size, especially making the photo responsive. As such, the breakpoint for the desktop seems larger than it should be. This is something I may want to come back and fix once I've learned more.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell | Conquering Responsive Layouts Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) - I'm still early in this mini free course and much of it is covering stuff I already know about responsiveness, but it has also helped me really fill in the blanks on some basics I missed with other resources. I feel like this gave me a better foundation for this project than I had on my previous two.
